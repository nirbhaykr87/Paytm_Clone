## 📌 What I learned from this Project? 📝 
- The project is made entirely with html and bootstrap css, so I learned about bootstrap in-depth.
- I learned how to make beautiful cards with hover effect 
- Learned about `transalte` property to change the position of arrow inside button on hover.
- Learned to use position `Relative` & `Absolute` with `z-index` in combination so that items can be stacked on top of each other.
- Learned about `Flexbox` and its properties `justify-content`, `align-items`, `gap` & `flex-direction`.
- Learned about animation properties
